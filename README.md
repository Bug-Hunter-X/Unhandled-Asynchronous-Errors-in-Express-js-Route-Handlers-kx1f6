# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Express.js

This example demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled errors within asynchronous route handlers.  When an asynchronous operation throws an error, if not properly caught and handled, it can lead to silent failures, making debugging difficult.

The `bug.js` file contains code that showcases this issue.  The `someAsyncOperation` function simulates an asynchronous task that might throw an error.  The error handling is incomplete. The error is logged to the console using `console.error`, but there is no response sent back to the client indicating the failure.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling, showcasing best practices for handling asynchronous errors in Express.js.

## How to reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the directory.
3.  Run `node bug.js`.
4.  Make a request to `http://localhost:3000`. The server will crash silently and the client won't receive an error response. 
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` and try again; the client will now receive an error response.
